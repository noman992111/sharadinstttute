        <h1 align="center" style="color: black;"> Earn & Learn Scheme</h1>
        <h2 align="center" style="color: black;">The main objective of the scheme is to develop a student as a multifaceted personality with academic excellence and a commitment to an egalitarian society. India lives in her villages and to bridge the gap between rural Bharat and urban India, this scheme is basically undertaken for the benefit of students coming from the rural areas, who are economically backward, intelligent, and meritorious but cannot afford higher education, needy and financially hard pressed. It inculcates in the student the idea that no work is big or small and develops a work culture with the right aptitude. This is a vision of keeping our youth gainfully employed as well as to contribute from civil society. This is a paradigm shift in the way we see higher education. This will make higher education accessible and available to the poor, meritorious and the marginalized.</h2>
